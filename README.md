# Sam's Simple Void Bootstrapper
Setup script for a minimal void environment (to make my life easier).
I'm sure anybody reads these, but just in case, excuse the novice code. This isn't meant to be the end all be all of
bootstrappers, but suggestions for improvements are welcome.
This is just a quick set up for a void i3wm setup. Nothing more, nothing less. Just comment out any packages you don't
like and run the script with sudo privileges (you still need to chmod +x ./bootstrapper.sh to execute it).

Notes: There are two network managers included, so pick your poison and delete/comment out the one you don't want.
Also, wallpaper isn't mine, just a placeholder.
